I am a graduate student from National University of Singapore, currently working as a Research Engineer in the department of mechanical engieering at NUS. I work under supervision of Prof. Gregory S. Chirikjian in the [Robot and Protein Kinematics (RPK) Laboratory](https://chirikjianlab.github.io).

My research interests includes **reinforcement learning**, **artificial intelligence** and **large language models** in robotics. I am committed to leveraging AI to equip robots with thinking brains and create more intelligent human-robot interaction.
