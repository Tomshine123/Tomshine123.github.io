(1) Learning to kick: Non-prehensile manipulation for quadruped robots.
* Generation of kicking motion: An effective MPC-based controller applied.
* Data fitting model: Used for making predictions on motion parameters.
* Continuous navigation: A locomotion controller trained by RL for reaching goal.
